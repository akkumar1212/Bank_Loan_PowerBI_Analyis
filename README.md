=> Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank’s loan portfolio to understand loan performance, identify high-risk borrowers, and highlight overall lending trends.
My goal was to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps the Department monitor Good vs. Bad loans, funding volumes, borrower characteristics, and risk indicators in real time.

=> Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Funded Amount: $416M+

Total Applications: 37K

Bad Loan Rate: ~14% (Primary risk metric)

=> Tools & Skills Used

Tool: Power BI Desktop

DAX: Built custom measures using CALCULATE, DIVIDE, FILTER, and others

Data Modeling: Star schema with clean relationships for efficient reporting

ETL: Power Query for date transformations and currency standardization

=> Visuals & Insights
1. Risk Breakdown (Good vs. Bad Loans)

A calculated column was created to classify loans as Good (Fully Paid) or Bad (Charged Off).
Insight: Grades F and G show a noticeably higher default rate, indicating the need for more cautious lending policies for these segments.

2. Time-Based Trends

Insight: Loan applications steadily increase month-over-month, with a noticeable peak during Q4—likely driven by seasonal financial activity.
